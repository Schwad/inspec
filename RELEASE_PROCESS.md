### Update Pending Release Notes

As each pull request is merged, update the [Pending Release Notes](https://github.com/inspec/inspec/wiki/Pending-Release-Notes). Some guidelines:
 * Don't include minor or non-customer visible changes, such as CI changes or test harness changes
 * Do include bug fixes, features, etc - things that impact the user.
 * Your words will be edited by the Docs team, but try help them along by keeping it human oriented; this isn't the technical-oriented CHANGELOG.
 * Add the PR number as a reference for the Docs team. They will typically remove them, but they may need to get more context by looking up the originating PR.
 * It's preferable to add notes as things merged, lest they be forgotten; siftingg through a pile of merged PRs in a rush is a chore!
